**Team:** `Group 1`

## 1. Preamble & Purpose

This is the Code of Conduct that contains the details of what is expected of the behavior of every member, collaboration, and even ethics of this team.
We also intend to create a respectful, inclusive, and high-performing workplace in which all its members feel valued, supported, and empowered to do their best work.
This publication is a rulebook to the way we relate to each other and an upholding of our team culture.

## 2. Our Core Values

These values are the foundation of our team's ethics and rules:

*   **Respect:** We value each other's time, opinions, and individuality.
*   **Integrity:** We are honest, transparent, and accountable for our actions.
*   **Collaboration:** We work together, share knowledge, and support each other's success.
*   **Excellence:** We are committed to producing high-quality work and continuously improving.
*   **Ownership:** We take responsibility for our tasks and the team's overall outcomes.

## 3. Code of Ethics: Our Guiding Principles

As a team member, I will:

*   **Act with Honesty and Fairness:** I will be truthful in my communication and fair in my dealings with all team members. I will not misrepresent facts or withhold crucial information.
*   **Respect Confidentiality:** I will safeguard sensitive information shared within the team, including personal data, proprietary business information, and private discussions.
*   **Take Responsibility for My Actions:** I will acknowledge my mistakes, learn from them, and focus on solutions rather than blame.
*   **Avoid Conflicts of Interest:** I will avoid situations where my personal interests could conflict with the team's goals. If a potential conflict arises, I will disclose it promptly.
*   **Give Credit Where It's Due:** I will acknowledge the contributions of my teammates and will not take credit for others' work.

## 4. Rules of Engagement & Behavior

### 4.1 Communication

*   **Professionalism:** All communication (in meetings, emails, chats) should be professional, constructive, and respectful. Avoid sarcasm, derogatory language, or personal attacks.
*   **Clarity & Brevity:** Be clear and concise. In written communication, use subject lines effectively and get to the point.
*   **Responsiveness:** Acknowledge messages within `[e.g., 24 hours]` during the work week, even if it's just to say you've seen it and will respond in full later.
*   **Active Listening:** In meetings, listen to understand, not just to reply. Allow others to finish their thoughts without interruption.

### 4.2 Meetings

*   **Punctuality:** Be on time for all meetings. If you are running late, notify the team via the group chat.
*   **Preparation:** Come prepared. Review the agenda and complete any pre-work.
*   **Participation:** Contribute constructively. If you are not speaking, be present and engaged.

### 4.3 Work & Collaboration

*   **Reliability:** Meet deadlines you have committed to. If you foresee a delay, communicate it proactively and as early as possible.
*   **Transparency:** Be open about your progress, challenges, and capacity. Do not silently struggle with a task.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Share information, resources, and learnings freely with the team. We succeed when we all grow.
*   **Constructive Feedback:**
    *   Give feedback that is specific, actionable, and kind. Focus on the work, not the person.
    *   Receive feedback with an open mind, as an opportunity for growth. Do not take it personally.
*   **Tool Usage:** We will use `GitHub` as our primary platform to keep work organized and accessible.

## 5. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

*   Bullying, or intimidation of any kind.
*   Public or private humiliation of a team member.
*   Malicious, disruptive, or obstructive behavior.
*   Gossiping or spreading rumors about other team members.

## 6. Conflict Resolution

We recognize that disagreements are normal. Our process for resolving them is:

1.  **Direct Discussion:** The involved parties will attempt to resolve the issue privately and respectfully.
2.  **Escalation:** If the conflict remains unresolved, it will be escalated to `Scrum Master` for a final decision.

## 7. Agreement

By agreeing to this Code of Conduct, I commit to upholding these standards and contributing to a positive and productive team environment.
